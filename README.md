# Predicting Heart Disease with Machine Learning
The backbone of this study is a dataset from a study of heart disease that has been open to the public for many years. The study collects various measurements on patient health and cardiovascular statistics, and of course makes patient identities anonymous. Thus, developing a Machine Learning Predictive Model that could enhance the predictive power of not only historical patient health data but also with present and future patient health data, with less bias and variance in the model, is the need of the day.
